# Customer_Segmentation_Clustering

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on customer segmentation using the KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Customer segmentation is a vital task in marketing that helps identify distinct customer groups based on their behaviors and characteristics. This project aims to uncover univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clusters within a dataset of mall customers.

# Project Overview
The main goals of this project are as follows:

Perform customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm.
Identify univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clusters.
Perform summary statistics on these clusters to identify the best marketing group.
Data
The dataset used for this project can be found in the data/ directory. It includes relevant information about mall customers, such as demographics, purchasing history, and visit frequency.

# Methodology
The project follows these general steps:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the data, visualize univariate, bivariate, and multivariate relationships among variables.

Feature Selection: Identify relevant features for clustering.

KMeans Clustering: Apply the KMeans algorithm to segment customers into clusters.

Cluster Evaluation: Evaluate cluster quality using relevant metrics.

Summary Statistics: Calculate summary statistics for each cluster to determine the best marketing group.

# Results
The results of the analysis, including cluster assignments and summary statistics, can be found in the results/ directory.

# Conclusion
Customer segmentation is a crucial step in designing targeted marketing strategies. By using the KMeans algorithm, we have identified distinct customer groups, allowing us to tailor marketing efforts more effectively.
